## Creating `tasks.json`
press Ctrl+Shift+P or F1 and then type **>Initialize Pawn Build Task**

#### Explanation
`"command": "${workspaceRoot}/pawno/pawncc.exe",` is the important bit here,
this is the path to your Pawn compiler and I've assumed most of you have a
left-over `pawno` folder from that long dead text editor! This folder not only
contains Pawno but also the Pawn code compiler (`pawncc.exe`). You can safely
delete `pawno.exe` forever.

`"args": [...],` is also important, this is where you define the arguments
passed to the compiler. Pawno also did this but you might not have known. The
defaults have always been `-;+` to force semicolon usage and `-(+` to force
brackets in statements.

If you store your Pawn compiler elsewhere, just replace the entire `command`
setting with the full path to your compiler.

Also, if you want to disable debug symbols (you won't be able to use
crashdetect) just remove `-d3` from `"args"`.

`problemMatcher` is the part that allows recognising the Pawn compiler output
and presenting it in the `problems` panel of the editor. This doesn't work well
with external includes because the paths change from relative to absolute.

## Compiling Pawn Code
To actually compile after you've set up the `tasks.json` below, press
CTRL+Shift+B (Windows) or CMD+Shift+B (Mac), or alternatively open up the
command palette with CTRL+Shift+P (Windows) or CMD+Shift+P (Mac) and type
`Run Task`, hit enter and select `build-normal`.
